👋 Image Classification Project with TensorFlow and Keras!
==================================================

🔍 This project aims to develop a machine learning model that automatically classifies images as either dogs or cats, targeting a 90% accuracy rate.

🎯 By focusing solely on these two categories, I designed a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** and employed data preprocessing techniques to optimize performance while preventing overfitting.

💡 The optimized model achieved an solid 93% accuracy on the test dataset, successfully distinguishing between dogs and cats.

📝 The project includes detailed documentation on the data preparation, model architecture, and performance evaluation.

💻 Explore the project with the provided code and see how CNNs can effectively classify images!
